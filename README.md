## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Font Family

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- Using semantic HTML to improve accessibility and SEO.
- Applying Flexbox to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Implementing a mobile-first design approach to ensure usability across devices.

Example of semantic HTML:

```html
<main class="profile-card">
    <header class="profile-card__header">
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-card__image">
        <h1 class="profile-card__name">John Doe</h1>
        <p class="profile-card__location">Location: Somewhere</p>
    </header>
    <p class="profile-card__bio">This is a brief bio about John Doe.</p>
</main>
```

Example of CSS using BEM methodology:

```css
.profile-card__links {
    display: grid;
    gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Further explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Enhance my knowledge of accessibility standards to ensure my designs cater to all users.
- Continue improving my skills with responsive design techniques to provide the best user experience.
